# Big Editorial H1 — Fraunces

Welcome! This post shows how our **modern + professional** blog styles render. Body text uses Inter, while headings use Fraunces for that creative, editorial vibe.

## Links, Emphasis, and Inline Code

Links pick up our warm accent: [Book a portrait session](/contact).  
Inline code looks like `npm run build` and can appear in a sentence.

You can also use **bold** and _italic_ for emphasis, and mix them with links like **[about me](/about)**.
